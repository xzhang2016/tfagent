# TFTA
TFTA (Transcription Factor and Target Agent): The TFTA's task is to search for targets for known transcription factors, and TFs for known targets; TF and target involved in specific pathways and tissues; TF and target involved in specific GO terms;microRNA and target relationship; find evidence for given regulation from both our database and literatures. It also provides enrichment analysis, such as GO enrichment, pathway enrichment, and disease enrichment.

TFTA is designed to be launched in a commucation system. Its ability is limited when running by itself. Welcome to visit our [biodialog system](http://dialogue.bio).

KQML messaging classes used by the agent are available [here](https://github.com/bgyori/pykqml).

INDRA is available [here](https://github.com/sorgerlab/indra).

# Installing TFTA
Note that currently the TFTA has limited usage on its own. It's
meant to be launched in the context of a communication system. 

`pip install git+https://github.com/xzhang2016/tfagent.git`

# Note
